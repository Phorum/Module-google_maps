Changelog:
----------

2011-04-11 v2.0.5 (Maurice Makaay)

    - Restored the functionality of searching for the user's location
      by writing a search string and hitting <enter>.

    - Fixed the use of a Phorum 5.3 API call in the code.
      Thanks go to Robert Angle for reporting the issue.

    - Extended the upgrade documentation, to note that 2.0.4 and up use
      new module templates, that the admin might have to copy to a
      customized module template.

    - Fixed the usermap addon for MSIE8 and before. The markers did not
      show up due to a javascript issue. 

2011-04-01 v2.0.4 (Maurice Makaay)

    - Fixed a bug that caused the map in the control center to show
      the previous map state instead of the new one, after saving the
      data. The data was correctly stored, but the map did not show
      the new state.

    - Changed the module to present a separate "Location" panel,
      instead of putting the location map on the user data
      panel in the control center. The map interface is so big, that
      it deserves a separate panel.

2011-01-04 v2.0.3 (Maurice Makaay)

    - Applied a few small fixes to make the google_maps_user_info hook
      work correctly. There was a typo in the hook check and a Phorum 5.3
      API call was used. Thanks to korsakov for the notice.

2010-12-01 v2.0.2 (Maurice Makaay)

    - The {MOD_GOOGLE_MAPS} template variable is now setup correctly.

2010-10-26 v2.0.1 (Maurice Makaay)

    - Simplified the placement of maps inside pages, by making maps
      scale to their surrounding divs, instead of having to configure
      the size of the map on the various pages via template settings.

    - Fixed a few styling issues.

2010-10-26 v2.0.0 (Maurice Makaay)

    - A big rewrite to incorporate the Google Maps API version 3.
      Version 2 of the API has been officially deprecated by Google.

    - Streetview can now be used in the location configuration for a user.

    - Added a hook "google_maps_user_info" to the usermap. This hook can
      be used to modify the contents of the plotted data. Most noticeably,
      this hook can be used to change the contents of the info window
      for the marker.

    - Retrieving the country and city for the user location has been moved
      into the GUI front end. This cancels the requirement for supporting
      HTTP requests and the JSON PHP extension on the webserver.

    - When the browser supports it, then the user can make use of
      geolocation to automatically lookup the current location.

    - The Fluster2 library has been incorporated in the usermap addon.
      This library takes care of clustering markers on the map, which
      greatly improves the usability and performance of the map in case
      there are a lot of user locations to plot.

2010-10-20 v1.2.0 (Thomas Seifert)

    - Added retrieving the city and country of the user on saving their 
      position. This makes it possible to show the city and/or country 
      e.g. on the read page. 
      (requires json_decode and a way to do remote access)

    - Dropped support for the (ancient) Real Names module for Phorum 5.1.

    - The display name is now used on the usermap, instead of the username.

    - Dutch translations were added by Maurice.

    - Some changes to make the module compatible with Phorum 5.3.

2008-11-22 v1.1.7

    - Fixed the PHP warning "Failed opening '' for inclusion".
      Thanks to Phorum user sheik (a.k.a. /\dam) for reporting
      the problem.

2008-11-01 v1.1.6

    - Fixed a problem in the usermap. The user API call for retrieving
      all users that have a location set was not using the correct
      arguments. Thanks for Bert Garcia for noticing the problem.

2008-02-11 v1.1.5

    - Fixed {/LOOP} to {/LOOP MOD_GOOGLE_MAPS_USERS} in the usermap
      template. This prevents a template warning when viewing the user map.

    - Fixed an undefined index warning in the usermap.
      Thanks to Oliver Riesen for the bug report and fix.

2008-01-04 v1.1.4

    - Cleaned up the language files a bit.

    - Created a work around in the code to be able to use HTML entities
      in the language strings that are used in JavaScript alert()s.
      Unfortunately, these do not allow direct use of HTML entities,
      causing them to show up verbatim.

2008-01-01 v1.1.3

    - Added a new language string "UserMapNoUsers" to be able to localize
      the usermap for cases where no user locations are available (yet).
      This language string is used in the new template file
      "usermap_nousers.tpl".

    - The addon now makes use of the new phorum_output() function. This
      makes the output 5.2 compliant and it fixes a problem with the
      recent messages module link not being set (thanks to Berti for
      noticing the problem).

    - Moved german_sie.php to german.php to comply with the other language
      files and included language fixes (as proposed by Berti).

    - When unsetting the position of the map in the control center, it
      now resets to the exact state in which the admin module settings
      map is saved (center point, zoom level and map type).

    - A few changes were made in the code for compatibility with the
      application/xhtml+xml content type.

    - Fixed the info popup baloon position for the usermap (it was a
      bit too far to the right).

    - Added French translation. Thanks to notre-planete.info!

2007-12-31 v1.1.2

    - Some semi-colons were missing in the JavaScript code,
      which could make it fail in a few occasions.

    - Improved the emerald usermap template and put the heading in the
      {HEADING} template variable instead of the usermap template.
      Also cleaned out the description, so it doesn't show on the
      addon usermap page (as proposed by Berti).

    - Removed the "default" template from the package. In 5.2 that has
      been replaced by "emerald".

2007-08-20 v1.1.1

    - Forgot to keep track of the install state for the module.
      Thanks to Thomas for noticing!

2007-08-20 v1.1.0

    - Made the module Phorum 5.2 compatible. It now uses the custom
      profile field API to create the custom profile field on the fly
      and the user API for building the addon map, showing the locations.
      of all users.

    - Straightened out some things in the module templates. The settings.tpl
      file is a real template file now.

2007-03-31 v1.0.6

    - The mapframe.php script always loaded the english language due
      to a bug. Thanks to regdos for finding the bug.

2007-03-29 v1.0.5

    - The previous bugfix introduced a different bug: saving profile data
      on any panel which does not contain the Google map clears the
      user's position. Thanks to cbob for finding the bug.

    - Fixed a newline representation bug in the alert message in case
      a location is not found based on a search string. This showed
      "\n" before. While I was at it, I changed the "\n" in the
      language code to "\r\n", which makes it more compatible with
      MSIE.

    - Added language support (polish.php and polish_utf8.php).
      Thanks to regdos.

    - No user location map is shown in the profile anymore if no
      location was set by the user.

2007-03-13 v1.0.4

    - Fixed two bugs reported by regdos. These were the results of
      some major refactoring of the map tool, to make it easier to
      use from other pages than the module pages alone. Fixed are:
      - the not working location search;
      - the inability to unset the previoiusly selected location
        to fully clear the location in the control center of the user.

    - Included CMU versioning info. For more info see:
      http://www2.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?16,120856

2007-02-26 v1.0.3

    - If a user saved some profile data on another control center page
      than the page on which the Google map was, then the location
      info would get lost. This bug is now fixed.
      Thanks to Bert Körn for reporting this problem.

    - Added language support (german_du.php).
      Also thanks to Bert Körn for this one.

    - Changed Stammgast -> Benutzer in the German language file and
      created a german_sie.php based on german_du.php.
      Please let me know if my German sucks ;-)

2007-01-29 v1.0.2

    - The iframe in the map viewer had a wrong id. Changed id "maptool"
      to "maptool_iframe". This had no repercussions on the active
      functionality of the module.

    - Implemented a user map, which plots all known user locations
      on a map. The URL to the addon is put in the template variable
      {URL->MOD_GOOGLE_MAPS_USERMAP}, so you can use that to add a
      link on your page to the user map.

    - Added support for displaying real names on the user map instead
      of usernames. For this to work, you should also have installed
      version 2.1.0 of the Real Name module.

2007-01-29 v1.0.1

    - Big code cleanup and a lot of changes for making the map tool easy
      to use from other Phorum modules, so they can implement geotagging
      anything in Phorum.

    - Changed the way in which the user interacts with the map. No marker
      is shown, unless the user clicks on the map to place the marker.
      After that, the marker can be moved by either clicking on a different
      location or by dragging and dropping the marker.

    - Since the map in the admin interface is only used for setting the
      start view for the map that the user gets when selecting a location,
      there was no use in showing a marker there. So I completely removed
      the marker from that interface.

    - All data is now saved when submitting a map. So map center, marker
      position, map type and zoom level are stored. Using this, the user
      can exactly configure how the map will be shown in the profile.

    - Made the module work correctly inside portable and embedded
      environments.

    - Make use of the javascript constants G_...._MAP for handling
      the map types, so we won't run into problems with localized
      versions of the Google Map system.

2007-01-24 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
