Changelog:
----------

2007-03-31 v1.0.6

    - The mapframe.php script always loaded the english language due
      to a bug. Thanks to regdos for finding the bug.

2007-03-29 v1.0.5

    - The previous bugfix introduced a different bug: saving profile data
      on any panel which does not contain the Google map clears the
      user's position. Thanks to cbob for finding the bug.

    - Fixed a newline representation bug in the alert message in case
      a location is not found based on a search string. This showed
      "\n" before. While I was at it, I changed the "\n" in the
      language code to "\r\n", which makes it more compatible with
      MSIE.

    - Added language support (polish.php and polish_utf8.php).
      Thanks to regdos.

    - No user location map is shown in the profile anymore if no
      location was set by the user.

2007-03-13 v1.0.4

    - Fixed two bugs reported by regdos. These were the results of
      some major refactoring of the map tool, to make it easier to
      use from other pages than the module pages alone. Fixed are:
      - the not working location search;
      - the inability to unset the previoiusly selected location
        to fully clear the location in the control center of the user.

    - Included CMU versioning info. For more info see:

2007-02-26 v1.0.3

    - If a user saved some profile data on another control center page
      than the page on which the Google map was, then the location
      info would get lost. This bug is now fixed.
      Thanks to Bert Körn for reporting this problem.

    - Added language support (german_du.php).
      Also thanks to Bert Körn for this one.

    - Changed Stammgast -> Benutzer in the German language file and
      created a german_sie.php based on german_du.php.
      Please let me know if my German sucks ;-)

2007-01-29 v1.0.2

    - The iframe in the map viewer had a wrong id. Changed id "maptool"
      to "maptool_iframe". This had no repercussions on the active
      functionality of the module.

    - Implemented a user map, which plots all known user locations
      on a map. The URL to the addon is put in the template variable
      {URL->MOD_GOOGLE_MAPS_USERMAP}, so you can use that to add a
      link on your page to the user map.

    - Added support for displaying real names on the user map instead
      of usernames. For this to work, you should also have installed
	  version 2.1.0 of the Real Name module.

2007-01-29 v1.0.1

    - Big code cleanup and a lot of changes for making the map tool easy
	  to use from other Phorum modules, so they can implement geotagging
	  anything in Phorum.

    - Changed the way in which the user interacts with the map. No marker
	  is shown, unless the user clicks on the map to place the marker.
	  After that, the marker can be moved by either clicking on a different
	  location or by dragging and dropping the marker.

    - Since the map in the admin interface is only used for setting the
	  start view for the map that the user gets when selecting a location,
	  there was no use in showing a marker there. So I completely removed
	  the marker from that interface.

    - All data is now saved when submitting a map. So map center, marker
	  position, map type and zoom level are stored. Using this, the user
	  can exactly configure how the map will be shown in the profile.

    - Made the module work correctly inside portable and embedded
	  environments.

    - Make use of the javascript constants G_...._MAP for handling
	  the map types, so we won't run into problems with localized
	  versions of the Google Map system.

2007-01-24 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
